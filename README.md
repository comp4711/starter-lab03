Assumed: CI system folder is in ../system3

If you change the system folder configuration setting, your webapp will break
when I try to test it on my system!

##################
## Coding Conventions
##################
- key words have a space between the word and parentheses, 
```php
  if () {}
```
- blocks have the opening bracket on the same line
```php
  switch () {
  
  }
```
- variable names are camel case. Start with a lowercase and every word after starting with a uppercase, 
```php
  $thisIsSomething = true;
```
- leave a space after all of the variable declarations
```php
  $one = 1;
  $two = 2;
  $three = 3;
  
  // Start logic here
```
